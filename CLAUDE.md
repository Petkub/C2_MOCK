# C2_MOCK: POSN Camp 2 Practice Judge

A terminal judge that students run on their own machines to practice for the POSN Computer Olympiad (Camp 2: 4 sets x 5 problems, no subtasks).
Sibling repo `C1_MOCK` is the Camp 1 judge (same structure); fix shared bugs in both.
Today it judges batch problems (`judge.py`). We are adding interactive and communication problems,
and a safe self-update mechanism so bugs can be fixed without re-sending zip files.

## Hard constraints (never break these)

1. **Python 3.7+ standard library only.** No pip packages. Students have Python and g++, nothing else.
2. **Student machines run Windows, macOS and Linux.** Every change must work on all three.
   Use `os.name == "nt"` guards like `judge.py` does. Never assume `/tmp`, `fork`, `resource`, or bash.
3. **Never touch student code.** The updater may write only inside the `Judge/` folder, and only
   files listed in `manifest.json`. It must never read, move, delete or overwrite `Mock_*/*.cpp`.
4. **Never delete files the updater does not own.** No "wipe and reinstall" step, ever.
5. **Fail safe.** If the network is down, slow (>2 s), or a hash does not match, keep the current
   version and continue silently. A broken update must never stop a student from judging.
6. **Do not change the existing look.** New commands reuse `Style`, `box`, `rule`, `bar`, `compile_source`
   and the scoring functions from `judge.py` so everything feels the same (verdict table, score bar).
7. **Output is English, ASCII-safe.** Keep the `--ascii` and `--no-color` fallbacks working.

Student-side layout (what `build_dist.py` produces): `C2_Mock_Test/Judge/` = `core/` + `problems/`,
and `C2_Mock_Test/Mock_K/1.cpp ... 5.cpp` = student files. The repo layout is **not** the student layout.
`judge.py` finds batch data in the first existing of `Judge/problems/batch/` (student package),
`../problems/batch/` (repo, run from `core/`) and `Judge/tests/` (older zips, JSON files next to judge.py).

## Compact test data and progress (C2 only)

- Each problem folder has `gen.py` and a per-problem `manifest.json` (not the updater's `manifest.json`).
  Tests with `"in_file": false` are not shipped: `judge.py` rebuilds them with `gen.py` the first time the
  problem is judged and checks their SHA-256. `"out_file": false` outputs are compared by hash only.
- Judging in the repo (`python3 core/judge.py ...`) writes those big inputs into `problems/batch/` and a
  `core/progress.json`. Never commit them; `build_dist.py` leaves them out, and the regression tests run inside
  a temporary built package so they never create them.
- `Judge/progress.json` is the student's own history (best score per problem). Never ship or overwrite it.
- The C2 judge has no `judge.py 3` shorthand: use `judge.py 3.cpp` (the Makefile and judge.bat do).

## Interactive protocol (already implemented, keep compatible)

- Interactor is called as `interactor <input-file> <output-file>` and talks to the student on stdin/stdout.
- Exit code: `0` OK, `1` Wrong Answer, `2` Presentation Error (treated as WA), `3` judge failure.
  One line on stderr is the message shown to the student. This matches testlib.
- The judge relays the pipes and records the conversation, so failures show a `you` / `judge` transcript.
- A student program that hangs while the judge waits gets a flush hint
  (`cin.tie(0); ios::sync_with_stdio(0);` disables the automatic flush; the course template has it).
- Times are wall-clock on the student's machine: fine for practice, not for ranking.

## Communication problems (next, design before coding)

Manager process + one or more student processes linked by pipes, with a stub/grader header the
student includes. Reuse the pipe relay and transcript code from `interactive_judge.py`.
Propose the design and wait for approval before writing it.

## Self-update rules

- `launcher/judge_launcher.py` is tiny and stable. It checks `manifest.json` (HTTPS only), downloads
  changed files to temp names, verifies SHA-256, then replaces atomically (`os.replace`).
- Keep the previous version of each replaced file in `Judge/.backup/`.
- Reject any manifest path that is absolute or contains `..`. Only paths under `Judge/` are allowed.
- Only update when `Judge/judge.py` exists in the target folder (guards against a wrong working directory).
- Provide `--update` (force) and show `Judge vX.Y` in the header box.
- Hosting is **undecided** (GitHub raw vs Cloudflare Pages vs other). Keep the base URL in one constant.
- New problem sets may add template `N.cpp` files only if they do not already exist.

## Commands

```
python3 tests/run_regression.py          # must pass before every commit
python3 tools/build_manifest.py          # after changing anything under core/ or problems/
python3 tools/build_dist.py              # build dist/C2_Mock_Test/ + dist/C2_Mock_Test.zip (--out DIR, --no-zip)
python3 core/judge.py samples/batch/towers_ok.cpp 1-1      # judge one file from the repo (creates big tests, see above)
python3 core/interactive_judge.py guess samples/interactive/guess_ok.cpp
```

## Working rules for Claude Code

- Before changing `judge.py`, run the regression tests; after changing it, run them again.
- Add a sample program + expected verdict for every new behaviour or bug fix.
- Keep functions small and readable, in the same style as `judge.py`. No new dependencies.
- If a change cannot be verified on Windows locally, say so and rely on the CI matrix.
- Ask before: changing the manifest format, the exit-code protocol, or anything in the updater.
